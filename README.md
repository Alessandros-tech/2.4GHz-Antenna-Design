# 2.4 GHz Antenna Design — CST Simulation & Real-World Validation

This repository contains the complete design, simulation, and physical testing of a **2.4 GHz dipole antenna**, developed using **CST Studio Suite** and validated through experimental measurements.

The goal of the project was to design an efficient antenna for the 2.4 GHz ISM band, simulate its electromagnetic behavior, fabricate a real prototype, and compare simulated vs measured results.
